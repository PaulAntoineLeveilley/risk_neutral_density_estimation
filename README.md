## Introduction

## To use the project
To use the project you need to install the dependencies listed in the `pyproject.toml` file. You can do so manually (not recomended) or use poetry.  
Poetry (https://python-poetry.org/) is a python dependency manager. If you have not installed it yet you can install it by runing `pipx install poetry` (you might need to install pipx first, see the documentation : https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/).
Once you have poetry installed, to install the dependencies of the project, cd into the project folder and simply run `poetry install`. Now the project has a dedicated virtual environement attached to it (that you can check by runing `poetry env info`) with all the defined dependencies installed. To run the project with this virtual environement, do `poetry run python main.py`.
